# Password Manager in Rust

This project was to create a password manager using a new language called Rust. You are able to save the password by naming and inputting the username associated with it. There is a master password that allows you to encrypt and decrypt the vault, which is stored locally as a encrypted JSON file. 

The vault is encrypted using AES-256-GCM, and the master password is hashed with SHA-256 to generate the encryption key.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download and install Rust
2. Download and install Cargo
3. Download the project files
4. Open a terminal in the project dir
5. Run the program: `cargo run`

Instructions for using the software:

1. When running it for the first time, create a master password 
2. After logging in, you will see a menu and select your option
3. When you choose Add Entry, you are able to store a new password by entering name, username, and password
4. When you choose List Entries, you can see all the saved entries (but it doesn't show the passwords associated with it)
5. When you choose Search you can search by name or username
6. When you choose Quit, it will quit the program

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* Rust
* Cargo
* Crates = aes-gcm, serge, serde_json, sha2, rand, rpassword, dirs

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [W3Schools Rust](https://www.w3schools.com/rust/)
* [Learning Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
* [Learning Rust Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAX3Zj-JGE0)
* [Rust Programming](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)
* [Encryption and Decryption AES-GCM 256](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/encryption-and-decryption-aes-gcm-256/100334)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more to the program in general
* [ ] Using/Programming a better Encryption
* [ ] Using/Programming a better Decryption
* [ ] Ability to delete or update existing entries
